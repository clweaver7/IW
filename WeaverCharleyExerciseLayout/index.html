            <p>
              The world of One Piece is populated by humans and other races such
              as dwarves (more akin to faeries in size), giants, merfolk,
              fish-men, long-limbed tribes, long-necked people known as the
              Snakeneck Tribe, and animal people (known as "Minks"). The world
              is governed by an intercontinental organization known as the World
              Government, consisting of dozens of member countries. The Navy is
              the sea military branch of the World Government that protects the
              known seas from pirates and other criminals. There is also Cipher
              Pol which is a group of agencies within the World Government that
              are their secret police. While pirates are major opponents against
              the Government, the ones who really challenge their rule are the
              Revolutionary Army who seeks to overthrow them. The central
              tension of the series pits the World Government and their forces
              against pirates. The series regularly emphasizes moral ambiguity
              over the label "pirate", which includes cruel villains, but also
              any individuals that do not submit to the World Government's
              authoritarian—and often morally ambiguous—rule. The
              <em>One Piece</em> world also has supernormal characteristics like
              Devil Fruits,[Jp 1] which are mysterious fruits that grant whoever
              eats them transformative powers. Another supernatural power is
              Haki,[Jp 2] which grants its users enhanced willpower,
              observation, and fighting abilities, and it is one of the only
              effective methods of inflicting bodily harm on certain Devil Fruit
              users.

              The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy—a young man made of rubber
              after unintentionally eating a Devil Fruit—who sets off on a
              journey from the East Blue Sea to find the deceased King of the
              Pirates Gol D. Roger's ultimate treasure known as the "One Piece",
              and take over his prior title. Luffy sets sail as captain of the
              Straw Hat Pirates,[Jp 15] and is joined by Roronoa Zoro, a
              swordsman and former bounty hunter; Nami, a money-obsessed thief
              and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, an
              amorous but chivalrous cook. They acquire a ship, the
              <em>Going Merry</em>[Jp 16]—later replaced by the
              <em>Thousand Sunny</em>[Jp 17]—and engage in confrontations with
              notorious pirates. As Luffy and his crew set out on their
              adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including
              Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico
              Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky,
              a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and
              Jimbei, a whale shark-type fish-man and former member of the Seven
              Warlords of the Sea who becomes their helmsman. Together, they
              encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations,
              revolutionaries, secret agents, different types of scientists,
              soldiers of the morally-ambiguous World Government, and various
              other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their
              dreams.

            <p>
              Eiichiro Oda's interest in pirates began in his childhood,
              watching the animated series <em>Vicky the Viking</em>, which
              inspired him to want to draw a manga series about pirates.[2] The
              reading of pirate biographies influenced Oda to incorporate the
              characteristics of real-life pirates into many of the characters
              in <em>One Piece</em>; for example, the character Marshall D.
              Teach is based on and named after the historical pirate Edward
              "Blackbeard" Teach.[3] Apart from the history of piracy, Oda's
              biggest influence is Akira Toriyama and his series
              <em>Dragon Ball</em>, which is one of his favorite manga.[4]
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h3 id="development">Development</h3>
            <p>
              Oda's primary inspiration for the concept of Devil Fruits was
              <em>Doraemon</em>; the Fruits' abilities and uses reflect Oda's
              daily life and his personal fantasies, similar to that of
              Doraemon's gadgets, such as the Gum-Gum Fruit being inspired by
              Oda's laziness.[8] When designing the outward appearance of Devil
              Fruits Oda thinks of something that would fulfill a human desire;
              he added that he does not see why he would draw a Devil Fruit
              unless the fruit's appearance would entice one to eat it.[9] The
              names of many special attacks, as well as other concepts in the
              manga, consist of a form of punning in which phrases written in
              <em>kanji</em> are paired with an idiosyncratic reading. The names
              of some characters' techniques are often mixed with other
              languages, and the names of several of Zoro's sword techniques are
              designed as jokes; they look fearsome when read by sight but sound
              like kinds of food when read aloud. For example, Zoro's signature
              move is <em>Onigiri</em>, which is written as
              <em>demon cut</em> but is pronounced the same as
              <em>rice ball</em> in Japanese. Eisaku Inoue, the animation
              director, has said that the creators did not use these
              <em>kanji</em> readings in the anime since they "might have cut
              down the laughs by about half".[10] Nevertheless, Konosuke Uda,
              the director, said that he believes that the creators "made the
              anime pretty close to the manga".[10]
            </p>
            <p>
              Oda was "sensitive" about how his work would be translated.[11] In
              many instances, the English version of the
              <em>One Piece</em> manga uses one onomatopoeia for multiple
              onomatopoeia used in the Japanese version. For instance,
              <em>"saaa"</em> (the sound of light rain, close to a mist) and
              <em>"zaaa"</em> (the sound of pouring rain) are both translated as
              "fshhhhhhh".[12] Unlike other manga artists, Oda draws everything
              that moves himself to create a consistent look while leaving his
              staff to draw the backgrounds based on sketches he has drawn.[13]
              This workload forces him to keep tight production rates, starting
              from five in the morning until two in the morning the next day,
              with short breaks only for meals. Oda's work program includes the
              first three days of the week dedicated to the writing of the
              storyboard and the remaining time for the definitive inking of the
              boards and for the possible coloring.[14] When a reader asked who
              Nami was in love with, Oda replied that there would hardly be any
              love affairs within Luffy's crew. The author also explained he
              deliberately avoids including them in <em>One Piece</em> since the
              series is a shōnen manga and the boys who read it are not
              interested in love stories.[15]

            Written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda, <em>One Piece</em> has been
            serialized by Shueisha in the <em>shōnen</em> manga anthology
            <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> since July 22, 1997.[28][29] Shueisha
            has collected its chapters into individual
            <em>tankōbon</em> volumes. The first volume was released on December
            24, 1997.[30] By July 4, 2024, a total of 109 volumes have been
            released.[31]
          </p>
          <p>
            The first English translation of One Piece was released by Viz Media
            in November 2002, who published its chapters in the manga anthology
            <em>Shonen Jump</em>, and later collected in volumes since June 30,
            2003.[32][33][34] In 2009, Viz announced the release of five volumes
            per month during the first half of 2010 to catch up with the
            serialization in Japan.[35] Following the discontinuation of the
            print <em>Shonen Jump</em>, Viz began releasing
            <em>One Piece</em> chapterwise in its digital successor
            <em>Weekly Shonen Jump</em> on January 30, 2012.[36] Following the
            digital Weekly Shonen Jump's cancelation in December 2018, Viz Media
            started simultaneously publishing <em>One Piece</em> through its
            <em>Shonen Jump</em> service, and by Shueisha through
            <em>Manga Plus</em>, in January 2019.[37][38]
          </p>
          <p>
            In the United Kingdom, the volumes were published by Gollancz Manga,
            starting in March 2006,[39] until Viz Media took it over after the
            fourteenth volume.[40][41] In Australia and New Zealand, the English
            volumes have been distributed by Madman Entertainment since November
            10, 2008.[42] In Poland, Japonica Polonica Fantastica is publishing
            the manga,[43] Glénat in France,[44] Panini Comics in Mexico,[45]
            LARP Editores and later by Ivrea in Argentina,[46][47] Planeta de
            Libros in Spain,[48] Edizioni Star Comics in Italy,[49] and Sangatsu
            Manga in Finland.[50]

          <p>
            On July 21, 2017, <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> editor-in-chief
            Hiroyuki Nakano announced that Tomorrow Studios (a partnership
            between Marty Adelstein and ITV Studios) and Shueisha would commence
            production of an American live-action television adaptation of
            Eiichiro Oda's <em>One Piece</em> manga series as part of the
            series' 20th anniversary celebrations.[66][67] Eiichiro Oda served
            as executive producer for the series alongside Tomorrow Studios CEO
            Adelstein and Becky Clements.[67] The series would reportedly begin
            with the East Blue arc.[68]
          </p>
          <p>
            In January 2020, Oda revealed that Netflix ordered a first season
            consisting of ten episodes.[69] On May 19, 2020, producer Marty
            Adelstein revealed during an interview with SyFy Wire, that the
            series was originally set to begin filming in Cape Town sometime
            around August, but has since been delayed to around September due to
            COVID-19. He also revealed that, during the same interview, all ten
            scripts had been written for the series and they were set to begin
            casting sometime in June.[70] However, executive producer Matt Owens
            stated in September 2020 that casting had not yet commenced.[71]
          </p>
          <p>
            In March 2021, production started up again with showrunner Steven
            Maeda revealing that the series codename is
            <em>Project Roger</em>.[72] In November 2021, it was announced that
            the casting for the series includes Iñaki Godoy as Monkey D. Luffy,
            Mackenyu as Roronoa Zoro, Emily Rudd as Nami, Jacob Romero Gibson as
            Usopp and Taz Skylar as Sanji.[73][74] In March 2022, Netflix added
            Morgan Davies as Koby, Ilia Isorelýs Paulino as Alvida, Aidan Scott
            as Helmeppo, Jeff Ward as Buggy, McKinley Belcher III as Arlong,
            Vincent Regan as Garp and Peter Gadiot as Shanks to the cast in
            recurring roles.[75]
          </p>
          <p>
            The series was positively received by both fans and critics, and on
            September 15, 2023, Oda revealed that the show has been renewed for
            a second season.[76]
